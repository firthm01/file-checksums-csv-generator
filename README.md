# file-checksums-csv-generator
A simple script to generate a CSV file of checksums of all files within a directory. Useful for checking backup integrity.
E.g, run it in two directories, import CSVs in to Excel and use simple formulae to check for matches.
Written for a MacOS system - probably works on most Linux-based systems too.

## Usage:
./checksum.sh /path/to/directory/of/files /path/to/output_file.csv
